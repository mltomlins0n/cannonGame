Objects to make:
    Target generator - generate a target
        No test
    Shot - calculate the x y
        No test
    judge - judge if it missed or hit
        Test
    flow
        Test
    IntegerChecker
        Test
    counter
        No test
    rounder for output from velocity and angle
        No test


    target generator
    Given: I need a target
    When:I create target with an x and y
    Then:it is created with the x and y coordinates

    Given: I need to round my target
    When: I have my coordinates for x an y as doubles
    Then: I round my target coordinates to the nearest integer

flow Class
    given: I start a game
    when: I call flowClass method
    then: target method called once

    given: I enter a velocity and angle
    when: I call flowClass
    then: shot method is called

    given: i enter a velocity and angle
    when: I call flowClass
    then: IntegerChecker is called

    given: I have a valid shot
    when: i call my flowClass method
    then: the judge method is called

    given: I have a miss
    When: I call flowClass
    then: 1 is added to the counter

    given: I have a shot that hits
    when: I call flowClass
    then: the counter is returned

    given: You have an invalid input
    When: flowClass
    Then: judge is never called

    given: you have an invalid input
    when: flowClass
    then: Shot is never called

    Given: I am a  user
    When: the flow is called
    Then: the target is created

    Given: i have an input for a shot
    when: i call flow
    then: judge is called

target
     Given: I want to play the game
     When: the game is started
     Then: a target is created with (x,y) between 1 and 10

options
    mock target want to be able to set x,y
    need ability to set target values
    accept values in the constructor
    getters and setters variable declaration
    calling a method

shot

Given: I have a velocity and angle
When: I input a velocity 0 and an angle 90
Then: shot lands at 0,0;

judge

Given: I have a shot and a target
When: the shot lands
Then: the shot is determined to be a a hit or miss

Given: i have a shot and target
When: i have a shot (1,1) and target (1,1)
Then: it returns true

given: i have a shot and a a target
when: i have a shot (1,1) and target(2,2)
then: return false

given: I have a shot and a target
when: I have a shot (1,11) and target (2,2)
then: A funny response about how you are bad at the game
